# Correlation-Implementation

1.Correlation refers the degree to which 2 variables are interrelated.
2.In data analysis,it is used for:-
a) Identifying relationships
b) Reduce redundancy- Two very similar variables can be used as one.
c) Choose Predictive Features-Strong correlation suggests good candidates for regression.
3.In this code,I constructed the correlation matrix on a cars dataset
4. If we have lots of columns(features),we can only focus on the ones that satisfy a minimum threshold( I usually keep the threshold at 0.7)
5.Set annot=True,it shows the value of the correlation on the boxes.Eg (0.78)
